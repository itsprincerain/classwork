//               Q+A
// 1: 3 dways to delcare Variables (var, let, const)
// 2: selecting the value and typing the new value
// 3: We simply use the = to give the variable a new value.
// 4: declare - declaring a variable without assigning a value
//    assign -  assign() method copies all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the modified target object.
//    define - The define() function can be used to load the modules (module can be an object, function, class or a code which is executed after loading a module)
// 5: It allows the designer to focus on main logic without being distracted by programming languages syntax.
// 6:  I would say 60% of thinking how to code it and the rest of the time should be anwering and coding.






//STRINGS//
//create a varialble
let firstVariable; 
//assign it the value of the string "Hello World"
firstVariable= "Hello World"
//change the value of this variable to any number
firstVariable = 12
//store the value of firstvariable in a new variable called secondV
let secondVariable = firstVariable;
//change the value of secondvariable to any string
secondVariable = "any"


//what is the value of firtsVariable = 12
console.log(firstVariable)
 //create a variable YourName
let yourName = "RAIN RAIN"

console.log(`Hello my name is ${yourName}`)
