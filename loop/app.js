//inside paranthesis we have
//three statements:

//state 1:
//declare and initialize a variable
//scopeds to the for loop

//statemet 2:
// a condition that when true runs the
//code in the for loop


//state 3:
//incrementing of the variable in
//order ti eventually break the loop

//for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
//  console.log(i);
// if (i == 5)

//}

//1: declare and initialize variable
//2: check if condition is true
//3: console log runs and prints 0
//4: the variable i increments from 0 to 1

//5: check if condition is true
//6: console log runs and prints 1
//7: i increments from 1 to 2
//8: check if condition is true (it's not)
//9: exit loop, continue with rest of code

//break
//continue

//exercise 1:
//create for loop counting down 10 to 1 
// for (let i = 10; i > 0; i--) {
//  console.log(i)
// }

//exercise 2:
// write a for loop for the given output
// odd numbers

//for (let i = 1; index <10; i+=2) {
//  console.log(i)
//}

//exercise 3:
//create a loop that outputs multiples of 3 starting at 6 ending at 60
//for (let i = 6; index <63; i+=3) {
// console.log(i)
//}

//exercise 4:
//for (let i = 1; i < 8; i++) {
//  console.log("#".repeat(i))
//}

//while loop
//exercise 1: keep printing integers in multiples of 3 as long as integers are less than 35 using a while loop
